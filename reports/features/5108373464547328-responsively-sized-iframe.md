# Responsively-sized <iframe>

> **Report Week:** 2026-W35 | **Milestone:** Chrome 154 | **Category:** Enabled by default

## Overview

Allow sites to opt into iframes having responsive sizing (sizing the <iframe> element in the parent document to the iframe document's layout overflow sizing, so that scrolling in the child document is avoided).

### Motivation

This is a natural feature to have for iframes, when the site wants to
render the iframe content so that it looks seamless with the parent frame and avoids scrollbars.

## Ecosystem Status

- **Momentum:** Emerging (30 points)
- **Standards Alignment:** Chromium-Led
- **Sentiment:** Neutral
- **Executive Take:** Responsively-sized <iframe> is currently Enabled by default in Chrome 154. Ecosystem momentum is Emerging with Chromium-Led standards alignment and neutral developer pulse.

### Recommendations
- Shipping enabled by default in Chrome 154. Developers can begin adopting in production with appropriate feature detection.
- Firefox and Safari have not yet finalized positions. Use defensive feature detection (guarding with `if ("..." in window)`).
- No direct polyfill detected yet; progressive enhancement fallback required for non-supporting browsers.
