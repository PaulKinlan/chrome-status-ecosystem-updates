# Additional Windowing Controls

> **Report Week:** 2026-W41 | **Milestone:** Chrome 155 | **Category:** Enabled by default

## Overview

Enables web applications with the window-management permission to maximize(), minimize(), and restore() their windows, and to prevent resizing through setResizable(). Additionally, new CSS media features display-state and resizable enable scripts and content to adapt to the respective window states and resizability. These features improve the usability of VDI remote application windows in Web clients, especially when it comes to titlebar window controls. The new functionality enhances existing Window Management API features: https://chromestatus.com/feature/5252960583942144

### Motivation

Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) web clients have limited abilities to integrate remote application windows with the local desktop environment, which creates suboptimal experiences for their users. Currently, they can only present full disjoint remote desktop environments (e.g. in a local fullscreen window), or present individual remote applications in separate local windows with titlebar window controls that are inoperative, redundant, and confusing for users.

## Ecosystem Status

- **Momentum:** High (220 points)
- **Standards Alignment:** Chromium-Led
- **Sentiment:** Mixed / Skeptical
- **Executive Take:** Additional Windowing Controls ships enabled by default in Chrome 155, introducing programmatic window state management (window.maximize, minimize, restore, setResizable) alongside the display-state and resizable CSS media features. While delivering long-sought UI parity for enterprise VDI web clients and standalone desktop PWAs, the feature currently lacks cross-engine consensus and is not indexed in Baseline.

### Recommendations
- Actionable Advice: Implement these controls strictly as an optional progressive enhancement for installed desktop PWAs, always verifying the window-management permission and method availability prior to invocation. Avoid building windowing architectures that depend on programmatic resizing, ensuring robust fallbacks for Firefox, Safari, and standard browser tabs.
- Shipping enabled by default in Chrome 155. Developers can begin adopting in production with progressive feature detection.

- Standards Activity (Mozilla): Latest discussion from @michaelwasserman: "Client application window controls may indeed be limited by the OS, Window Manager, protocols, utilities, and modalities. The API surface offers coher..."
- No verified standalone runtime polyfill available; design progressive enhancement fallbacks for non-supporting browsers.
