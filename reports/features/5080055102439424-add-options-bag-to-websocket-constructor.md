# Add options bag to WebSocket constructor

> **Report Week:** 2026-W35 | **Milestone:** Chrome 154 | **Category:** Enabled by default

## Overview

Add support for passing an option bag (WebSocketInit dictionary) as the second argument to the WebSocket constructor. The option bag will initially support a "protocols" option, allowing developers to specify subprotocols (mirroring the existing protocols argument), and also serves as an extension point for future options.

Before, this would be written `const socket = new WebSocket("wss://example.com:8080", "soap")`. After, this could also be written `const socket = new WebSocket("wss://example.com:8080", { protocols: "soap" })`.

See https://github.com/whatwg/websockets/issues/42 and spec PR https://github.com/whatwg/websockets/pull/76 for this change.

### Motivation

There is a demand for extensibility of options on the WebSocket constructor, to mirror the "option bag" approach that the Fetch API has. https://github.com/whatwg/websockets/issues/42 is requested by a number of implementors and users, and Chromium wants this as a means to add a `targetAddressSpace` option matching the one added to Fetch for Local Network Access (https://wicg.github.io/local-network-access/#fetch-api).

## Ecosystem Status

- **Momentum:** Emerging (30 points)
- **Standards Alignment:** Chromium-Led
- **Sentiment:** Neutral
- **Executive Take:** Add options bag to WebSocket constructor is currently Enabled by default in Chrome 154. Verified ecosystem momentum is Emerging with Chromium-Led standards alignment and neutral developer pulse.

### Recommendations
- Shipping enabled by default in Chrome 154. Developers can begin adopting in production with progressive feature detection.
- Standards Activity (WebKit): Latest discussion from @annevk: "I suggest we resolve this as "position: support" one week from now. This is a straightforward addition that allows us to enhance WebSockets more easil..."
- No verified standalone runtime polyfill available; design progressive enhancement fallbacks for non-supporting browsers.
