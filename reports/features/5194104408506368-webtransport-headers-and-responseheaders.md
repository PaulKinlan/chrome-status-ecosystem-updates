# WebTransport headers and responseHeaders

> **Report Week:** 2026-W40 | **Milestone:** Chrome 153 | **Category:** In developer trial (Behind a flag)

## Overview

Adds support for passing custom HTTP request headers via WebTransportOptions and inspecting server response headers through the WebTransport instance. This allows web applications to supply metadata, authentication tokens, and custom parameters during the initial CONNECT handshake and access server-provided headers once the connection is established.

### Motivation

The WebTransport constructor requires support for custom HTTP request headers to address several technical limitations in authentication, routing, and capability negotiation.

Without custom headers, developers must pass authentication tokens in URL query strings, which exposes credentials in server logs and telemetry, or authenticate over an initial data stream, which adds an additional round trip before the connection is usable.

Furthermore, API gateways and reverse proxies typically inspect HTTP headers at the CONNECT layer. Without custom headers, these intermediaries cannot authorize or route WebTransport sessions via existing pipelines, forcing servers to accept connections before verifying credentials.

Finally, applications often need to negotiate capabilities, such as supported video codecs, during connection setup. Providing custom request headers in WebTransportOptions and a readable responseHeaders property on the WebTransport instance allows clients and servers to authenticate, route, and negotiate capabilities during the initial handshake. This eliminates the need for custom stream-level initialization protocols.

## Ecosystem Status

- **Momentum:** Emerging (20 points)
- **Standards Alignment:** Chromium-Led
- **Sentiment:** Positive
- **Executive Take:** The addition of \`headers\` in \`WebTransportOptions\` and the \`responseHeaders\` property closes a longstanding security and architectural gap in WebTransport by allowing standard HTTP metadata and authentication during the initial CONNECT handshake. Chromium has completed its developer trials and secured approval via an Intent to Ship with passing Web Platform Tests, moving the feature toward general availability. The broader ecosystem views this as a vital operational enhancement that brings WebTransport in line with standard HTTP proxying and gateway infrastructure.

### Recommendations
- Actionable Advice: Teams deploying WebTransport architectures should experiment with custom handshake headers in Chromium beta/developer flags to test gateway authentication and capability negotiation. However, production systems must maintain fallback mechanisms (such as initial bidirectional stream auth or ticket exchanges) until cross-browser support reaches Baseline.
- Non-Chromium browser engines (WebKit/Gecko) have not formally signaled support. Wrap calls in conditional feature checks.
- No verified standalone runtime polyfill available; design progressive enhancement fallbacks for non-supporting browsers.
