# CSS text-decoration-inset

> **Report Week:** 2026-W35 | **Milestone:** Chrome 154 | **Category:** Enabled by default

## Overview

CSS text-decoration-inset controls how far underlines, overlines, and line-through decorations are inset from or extended beyond text run edges. It supports auto, length, and percentage values, including one-value and two-value syntax for setting the start and end offsets. This lets developers adjust decoration spacing and create reveal effects with native text decorations instead of background gradients or additional elements.

### Motivation

This change implements CSS text-decoration-inset (CSS Text Decoration Level 4), including percentage values. It gives authors direct control over decoration inset and reduces the need for wrapper/pseudo-element workarounds used to fine-tune underline/overline/line-through rendering.

## Ecosystem Status

- **Sentiment:** Neutral
- **Executive Take:** CSS text-decoration-inset is currently Enabled by default in Chrome 154. Verified ecosystem momentum is Emerging with Chromium-Led standards alignment and neutral developer pulse.

### Recommendations
- Shipping enabled by default in Chrome 154. Developers can begin adopting in production with progressive feature detection.
- Non-Chromium browser engines (WebKit/Gecko) have not formally signaled support. Wrap calls in conditional feature checks.
- No verified standalone runtime polyfill available; design progressive enhancement fallbacks for non-supporting browsers.
