# CSS text-decoration-inset

> **Report Week:** 2026-W35 | **Milestone:** Chrome 154 | **Category:** Enabled by default

## Overview

CSS text-decoration-inset controls how far underlines, overlines, and line-through decorations are inset from or extended beyond text run edges. It supports auto, length, and percentage values, including one-value and two-value syntax for setting the start and end offsets. This lets developers adjust decoration spacing and create reveal effects with native text decorations instead of background gradients or additional elements.

### Motivation

This change implements CSS text-decoration-inset (CSS Text Decoration Level 4), including percentage values. It gives authors direct control over decoration inset and reduces the need for wrapper/pseudo-element workarounds used to fine-tune underline/overline/line-through rendering.

## Ecosystem Status

### Recommendations
- Shipping enabled by default in Chrome 154. Developers can begin adopting in production with appropriate feature detection.
- Firefox and Safari have not yet finalized positions. Use defensive feature detection (guarding with `if ("..." in window)`).
- No direct polyfill detected yet; progressive enhancement fallback required for non-supporting browsers.
